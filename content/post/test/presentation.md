Hello everyone, and welcolme to my website !

Gamardjoba, I am Lisandro "Edode" Chelidze, a French/Corse/Georgian student in CyberSecurity, and the beast on the left is Couic-Couic (read as Quick-Quick).
Couic-Couic is either a Seagull, a Duck or a Goose (I don't know, I'm not a bird expert), and he is my acolyte, helping me in my day-to-day work.

The goal of this website is to share my knowledge and my research, and to help people who are interested in CyberSecurity, or in any other topic I will talk about.

To present myself a little bit, I am completely self-taught, and I am specializing myself in Cyber Threat Intelligence.
I read a lot of articles, books, and I watch a lot of videos about everything that is related to CyberSecurity, and I try to stay up-to-date with the latest news.

I worked in apprenticeship as an Cybersecurity Innovation Engineer in Orange Cyberdefense (OCD), and as a R&D Security Engineer at Stormshield (Airbus Defense and Space).
When I am not at work, I am usually working on my own projects, or I am doing some CTFs. All my projects are publicly available on my GitHub,
and I hope that you'll find them interesting.

For my end of school thesis, I wrote a paper the use of Code Obfuscation in Malware, and I was strongly advised to publish it online for everyone to read.
I will soon post it on this website, so stay tuned !

As for the beast, Couic-Couic is a very special bird. He is very curious, and he likes to learn new things. He is also very smart, and he is a very good friend.
My girlfriend bought it for me when we went to the "Cité de la Voile Éric Tabarly" in Lorient (Brittany, France). I decided to make him my mascot, and he is a very good help !

Anyway, I hope you'll enjoy your stay on my website, learn new things, and have fun !
